2. Configure Activities

    ![configure-activities](docs/images/configure-activities.png)

    ![oauth2-redirect](docs/images/oauth2-redirect.png)

### Set OAuth info in project

1. Get your Applicaition cliend id and client secret

    * Cliet `Reset Secret` to get secret. This secret key would be hidden forever after you closing the site.

    ![oatuh2-id-secret](docs/images/oatuh2-id-secret.png)

2. Create `.env` file

    * `cp example.env .env`

3. Modify the value in `.env` file

  ```shell
  VITE_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID_HERE
  DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE
  ```

### Install nvm

* Windows
  * Windows user can directly download and install Node.js. [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
  * Windows user can also install `nvm`. [Link](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)

* Linux
  * Linux user recommands install nvm by command.
  * The `nvm` is a convenient tool to manage and switch Node.js version.

  ```shell
  # installs NVM (Node Version Manager)
  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash

  # may need to restart terminam after install nvm or it can not find nvm
  # download and install Node.js
  nvm install 20

  # verifies the right Node.js version is in the environment
  node -v # should print `v20.11.1`

  # verifies the right NPM version is in the environment
  npm -v # should print `10.2.4`
  ```

### Run client side app

1. Follow below command to launch app

    ```shell
    cd client

    # install needed packages
    npm install

    # install discord SDK if it does not be auto installed by above command
    npm install @discord/embedded-app-sdk

    # launch client app
    npm run dev

    # Output
    #  âžœ  Local:   http://localhost:5173/

            * `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173`

3. Set URL mappings
    * Set `root mapping` as `/`
    * Set `target` as the access address in step 2.
